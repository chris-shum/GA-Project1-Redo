##CheckList
###Overview:
I decided to recreate my first project from General Assembly just to see how far I've progressed compared to my [first attempt](https://github.com/chris-shum/GA-Project1).  This app now makes use of RecyclerViews and Dialogs.  

##How to use:

###Main screen:
  The main page is where you create the title of your lists.

  -To add a list title:
  Click on the "+" floating action button, enter the list title and hit add.

  -To edit/delete a list title:
  Long click on the list title, follow dialog box instructions.
  
  -To enter list and add items:
  Click on list name.


###In details screen:
The details screen displays the items in your list.

  -To add an item:
  Click on the "+" floating action button, enter the item name and description and hit add.

  -To edit/delete an item:
  Long click on the list title, follow dialog box instructions.
  
  -To return to main screen:
  Hit back button
  
##Todo:
  - Figure out best method to save data.  Currently reading up on [realm.io](Realm.io).
  
  - Would like to implement [https://medium.com/@ipaulpro/drag-and-swipe-with-recyclerview-b9456d2b1aaf#.6ovz9zuhb](Drag and Swipe with RecyclerView).

  - Improve design.
