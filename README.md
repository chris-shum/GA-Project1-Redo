##CheckList
###Overview:
I decided to recreate my first project from General Assembly just to see how far I've progressed compared to my <a href "https://github.com/chris-shum/GA-Project1">first attempt</a>.  This app now makes use of RecyclerViews and Dialogs.  

##How to use:

###Main screen:
  The main page is where you create the title of your lists.

  -To add a list title:
  Click on the "+" floating action button, enter the list title and hit add.

  -To edit/delete a list title:
  Long click on the list title, follow dialog box instructions.
  
  -To enter list and add items:
  Click on list name.


###In details screen:
The details screen displays the items in your list.

  -To add an item:
  Click on the "+" floating action button, enter the item name and description and hit add.

  -To edit/delete an item:
  Long click on the list title, follow dialog box instructions.
  
  -To return to main screen:
  Hit back button
  
##Todo:
  - Figure out best method to save data.  Currently reading up on <a href = "realm.io">Realm.io</a>.
  
  - Would like to implement <a href = "https://medium.com/@ipaulpro/drag-and-swipe-with-recyclerview-b9456d2b1aaf#.6ovz9zuhb">Drag and Swipe with RecyclerView</a>.

  - Improve design.
